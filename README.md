This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset from eBay to ensure data quality and reliability for analysis. Using Python, key data wrangling steps were performed, including excluding variables with significant missing data, removing duplicates, and correcting inaccuracies. The cleaned dataset served as a foundation for further analysis and visualization, enabling meaningful insights into eBay trends and patterns.
